title:  "Should you go to University for web design/development?"
---
As someone who's recently finished a three year bachelors degree course, aptly named 'Web Design', I'm in a pretty good position to share my insight in to a development orientated degree.

There's a pretty strong divide between those who favour academia (careful not to say education) over real-life experience, whether that be an internship or full-time.

It's fair to say that alot of what I learnt on the course was pretty outdated. Of course, that's partially down to the way in which course content has to be acredited before it's taught, but for the large part, it's due to the nature of the web: there's always something new. It only takes a quick look at sites like [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/frontend), or [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/), to get an idea of just how rapidly new plugins, apps, or ways of doing things are being produced.

But I think it's less about what you're learning, and more about how you're learning it. University provides you with three years to really get to grips with the field. It's not nescarily about honing your skills (you have the rest of your career to worry about that!), but more about learning about your industry.
