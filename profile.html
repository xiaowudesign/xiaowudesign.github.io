    <p>I'm Alex, a front-end engineer in London, currently working at Pusher. As part of the Creative team at Pusher, I work with other teams around the company (from marketing to product) to find the best solutions to building out the user-facing side of our products.</p>

    <p>Although I spend most of my day working with the front-end and design, I always enjoy playing around with server-side tech. But most of all, I enjoy making tools.
