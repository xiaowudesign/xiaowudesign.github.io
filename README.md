# Hi there!
This is the source code of my [personal site](https://alexpate.uk).

## What's the point of this repo?
Besides being an obvious place for me to keep track of my code, I would like to think that someone might find this useful. Got any questions, send me an email.

## Installation
Want to use this site locally?

- `git clone` the repo somewhere safe
- Run `bundle install && npm install`* 
- To serve the site, `gulp`
- The site should now be running at http://localhost:4000

**I prefer to bypass Jekyll's built in asset pipeline, and use Gulp.*
